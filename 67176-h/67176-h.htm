<p class="drop-cap">Volume Four brings Legend Land
nearer to the great centres of modern
life. It comprises some of the old
stories told of districts within easy reach
of such busy cities as London, Birmingham
and Bristol.</p>

<p>In it you will find historic and pre-historic romance
mingled. Some of its tales are as old as any in our
land, tales born of the very ancient belief that saw in
“Druid” stones a human origin. Other stories
are romances of much later date, of events almost
within the memory of our great-grandparents’
great-grandparents.</p>

<p>Here you will find two legends that come from
Shakespeare’s land, legends that must have been well
known to that great lover and teller of old tales.
And in the legend of Herne the Hunter you will recognise
a story which Shakespeare himself told in
“The Merry Wives of Windsor.” And it was
probably an old tale when he repeated it.</p>

<p>In “King Arthur’s Camelot” you meet with a
very old legend of that great hero of British historical
romance; and in the story of “Wayland Smith” you
get an echo of the lore of the old Pagan gods which
invading Anglo-Saxon tribes brought to England
soon after the Romans left it.</p>

<p>Manners and customs change; the old creeds die
as the new ones arise, yet&mdash;and it is very wonderful
to realize it&mdash;some of the old stories have survived
every phase of the passing centuries’ intolerance of
the past, and are told to-day in a form not so very
different from that in which they were first narrated
by our semi-savage ancestors, over their camp fires
in the heart of primeval English forests.</p>

<p>But civilization is “improving” away romance
very rapidly. And it is worth while to hang on fast
to the last remaining shreds of those other days when
life, though ruder, had more time for simple dreams
of wonderful things.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">High up on an outlying spur of the
Cotswold hills, where Warwickshire and
Oxfordshire meet, there is a sort of
miniature Stonehenge, known as the
Rollright Stones; and the Story they tell
about them is that they were once a king and his
courtiers who, by evil spells, were changed suddenly
into Stone.</p>

<p>The Rollrights are scattered about the hill top,
seven hundred feet above sea-level, a mile or so from
the quiet village of Little Compton. And this is the
old Story of how they came there.</p>

<p>Ever so long ago there came marching over the hills
a king and his army bent upon the conquest of
England. As they neared the summit of the hill the
king was met by a witch who told him that he had
nearly achieved his desire. She spoke in rhyme,
and her words are remembered in the neighbourhood
even now.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If Long Compton you can see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">King of England you shall be,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>she said. The king rushed forward, but, owing to
treachery on the part of some of his men, his view of
Long Compton, which lies in the valley below, was
impeded.</p>

<p>Then the witch turned to him with a croaking laugh,
and muttered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As Long Compton you can’t see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">King of England you shan’t be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rise up stick, and stand still stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For King of England you shall be none.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You and your men hoar stones shall be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I myself an elder tree.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>
<p>The unfortunate king, although within a few paces
of a spot from which he might have viewed Long
Compton and so become ruler of this realm, was
unable to move a step further. His joints became
stiff, his energy left him, and in a few minutes he
had turned into stone. And there you may see him
to-day as “the King Stone,” a grey weathered
monolith standing stark in a field, but in a place
from which Long Compton is invisible.</p>

<p>But his treacherous supporters who had hindered
him from success did not escape. The old story tells
that there were five knights who led the company.
Seeing their leader’s strange fate, they tried to
escape. But the same doom overtook them. A few
hundred yards from the “King Stone” is a group of
five large upright slabs. These are the “Whispering
Knights,” turned to stone in the very act of conspiring
against their king.</p>

<p>Nearer to the silent king is a circle of stones, once
his faithless soldiers, and all about grow elder trees,
said to be descendants of that witch who was herself
transformed into an elder after her magic spell had
worked upon the king and his men. They tell you that
if you stick a knife into these elders you will sometimes
draw blood.</p>

<p>The Rollright Stones form a weird relic of some
long forgotten time. Men have written of their
strange appearance throughout many centuries. Bede
called them the second wonder of the kingdom.
Whether the legend of their formation be true or
not, it must have been some very important event that
caused them to be erected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>You may best reach them from Rollright station on
the line between Banbury and Chipping Norton, and
if you dare venture up to visit them on a moonlight
night, they say you may find the fairies at their revels,
dancing all about.</p>

<p>This is a peaceful English country of hill and vale,
fine country estates&mdash;Compton Winyates with its
matchless Tudor mansion is near at hand&mdash;and little
churches, rich in architecture, that will repay a
visit. Here you are on the outskirts of Shakespeare’s
land, real generous England, full of history, that has
not changed so very much since the spacious days of
Elizabeth&mdash;the England that the English tourist all
too seldom sees.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Near the middle of England, where the
Malvern Hills rise abruptly to a height
of nearly 1,400 feet above the sea, is the
double-peaked rugged Raggedstone hill
about which several strange old legends
centre. A restless spirit is said to haunt the bleaker
portions of the summit, but a stranger legend is
that of the Shadow Curse, called down upon this
hill by a monk of Little Malvern in the olden time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Little Malvern lies in the plain at the foot of these
hills, and at the Benedictine monastery there, as the
old story tells, there was once a rebellious brother.
His offences against the monastic discipline were so
serious that the Prior decreed, as his punishment,
that he should crawl on hands and knees every
day and in all weather, for a certain period, from the
monastery to the top of the Raggedstone and back
again.</p>

<p>The wretched monk had to obey, and day after day,
week after week, he performed his penance. But the
pain and degradation of his task embittered him, and
they say that before his punishment was completed
he died upon the hill of exhaustion and humiliation.
Others say that he sold his soul to the devil in order
to be free of his hated task, but anyhow before he
disappeared from human ken, he put a bitter curse
upon the hill that had caused him so much suffering.</p>

<p>He cursed with death or misfortune whomsoever
the shadow of the hill should fall upon, having in mind
that in those days of sparsely populated land the
people who would suffer most would be the Prior
and his brethren in the monastery beneath.</p>

<p>Now the shadow of the Raggedstone is very seldom
seen. Only at rare times when the sun is shining
between the twin peaks does it appear, and those who
have seen it describe it as a weird cloud, black and
columnar in shape, which rises up between the
two summits and moves slowly across the valley.</p>

<p>Many stories were told, in times past, of the misfortunes
that happened to those upon whom this uncanny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
shadow fell; and it is recorded that Cardinal Wolsey
was once caught by this weird cloud, and to that the
old folk attributed the misfortune that came to the
proud man when at the height of his power.</p>

<p>Wolsey in his early days was a tutor to the Nanfan
family whose house was at Birts Morton Court, a
couple of miles from the foot of Raggedstone. The
young tutor fell asleep in the orchard one day, and
awoke suddenly, shivering, to find the strange unearthly
shadow moving across the trees.</p>

<p>Much of Little Malvern Priory, the home of that
miserable monk of long ago, remains to-day. Its
domestic buildings are almost intact, with amazing
good fortune having escaped the common fate of such
edifices. There are, too, the old monkish fish ponds,
now lily spangled in spring time, and an old preaching
cross. The parish church is part of the old priory
church and contains a finely carved rood screen and
some most interesting stained glass.</p>

<p>Great Malvern, some three miles away, clinging
as it were to the side of the great Worcestershire
Beacon, is a place with world-wide fame. It, too,
has its great priory church, and all the attractions
and conveniences of a favourite inland resort.</p>

<p>But the chiefest charm of the Malverns&mdash;there are
seven of them&mdash;is their hills. These form a glorious
range, of varying barren and wooded mountainous
country, flung as it were as a far outpost beyond
Severn of the wild Welsh mountains many miles to the
westward.</p>

<p>The view from these Malvern Hills is, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
unequalled. They say nobody knows exactly how
much of England and Wales can be seen from them.
Fifteen counties are certain, and in that range is
included the Wrekin, the Mendips, and the Welsh
mountains as far as Plinlimmon.</p>

<p>On the fine upstanding Herefordshire Beacon is,
perhaps, the best specimen of an ancient British camp
that we have. Tradition says that here Caractacus
defended himself from the Romans.</p>

<p>It was “on a May morning on Malverene Hulles”
that Piers Plowman had that vision of which Langland
wrote five hundred and more years ago.</p>

<p>Few centres in our country offer such varied scope
to the holiday-maker as the Malverns, where nature
and history vie with one another in the matter of
attractions.</p>

<p>The fresh upland air is tonic and health-giving.
That weird dark shadow of the Raggedstone can never
have fallen here, or, if it have, its mystical power has
become impotent by reason of the many beauties of
the place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW BATH WAS DISCOVERED.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Some people may tell you that the
Romans discovered Bath, but the old
story gives the honour to a British
Prince, Bladud, who is, variously, said
to have been the father of King Lear,
and the eldest son of King Lud. Like these two
illustrious monarchs, Bladud came in time to be king
of Britain. But that was after he had passed through
a very sad experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Prince Bladud, as was becoming the eldest son of a
king, spent many years in Athens studying the liberal
arts and sciences. But, alas! while in Greece he
became a leper, and on his return to Britain he had
to be shut away from his fellow-men, for fear that he
should infect them with the dreaded disease.</p>

<p>The Prince bore his confinement patiently for a
time, but at last it became unendurable, and he
escaped in disguise, and went out into the world to
forget his royal birth and to earn his living as best he
could. His wanderings brought him to the hamlet
of Swainswick, a few miles from where Bath now
stands, and there he found the only occupation given
to one afflicted as he was, that of a swineherd.</p>

<p>Here for some time he carried on his lowly duties,
content to be a free man, no matter how humble
his station in life. And they say that early one
winter’s morning when he was out in the neighbouring
woods with his pigs, the animals suddenly
became restive. Before he could stop them a large
part of the herd had taken panic and rushed furiously
down a hill-side into a swamp, at the foot where
they began to wallow in the mud.</p>

<p>Bladud pursued them, wondering that pigs should
seek to roll in cold muddy water on a winter’s day.
But when he reached them, he found, to his surprise,
that the water and slime in which they rolled was hot,
and that steam arose from the marsh. This explained
the problem to the Prince, though he marvelled greatly
at the existence of such springs.</p>

<p>But there was another surprise in store for him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
He noticed that those pigs that habitually went to the
hot swamp were in ill-health and afflicted, somewhat
like himself, with skin diseases. After a short time
they became fat and well, their coats as clean and
glossy as any in the herd.</p>

<p>“If this marvel can come to base animals,”
Bladud mused, “why should it not come to me?”
So he determined to try the effect of the hot springs
upon his own complaint, and after a few weeks’ bathing
in them, to his intense joy, he found his leprosy
leaving him. By summer he was cured completely
of his affliction, and he returned to the king, his
father, to announce his good fortune.</p>

<p>King Lud, who had mourned him as dead, was
over-joyed to see his eldest son again; more joyful
still to find him cured. So Bladud resumed his
duties at Court, and in due time, when Lud died, he
became King of Britain. Then it was, as a token of
gratitude, and that others might benefit from the
miraculous waters he had found, that he built a great
city on the scene of his cure, and that city we know
to-day as Bath.</p>

<p>Of course, when the Romans came, they were
delighted to find this wonderful “spa” as we call it.
They put up great buildings, and their chief men
visited Aquæ Sulis, as they called it, to be cured of
gout and rheumatism, and a score of other complaints.
And because of the wonderful buildings they left
behind them&mdash;and many of them remain to this day&mdash;people,
who do not know the old story, say that they
founded the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>But no matter who really did found it, we know that
for nearly 2,000 years people have been visiting Bath
and finding a cure there which they have sought elsewhere
in vain.</p>

<p>Bath is a wonderful city set in glorious surroundings,
and you need not be an invalid to enjoy a visit
there. With its memories and relics of Beau Nash,
and the spacious days of the eighteenth century; its
wonderful old Abbey Church, its Roman remains
and its sunny sheltered walks, Bath is an amazingly
attractive place in which to spend a holiday. The
country round about is full of interest, the town
possesses every attraction a holiday resort should
possess.</p>

<p>Of its waters, let the doctors speak. They will
speak of them as enthusiastically as Bladud must
have done, and tell you that, in Bath, you may find all
the benefits that so many people travel hundreds of
miles to Continental spas to seek.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KING ARTHUR’S CAMELOT.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">This is the story the people of the
country-side have been telling from time
out of memory. Very learned men have
disputed their facts and warred and
wrangled over great Arthur’s history,
and you must please yourself which side you take,
but this is a story of Cadbury Castle, which tradition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
holds was King Arthur’s Camelot, where that
famous hero:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“ ... kept his Court Royall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his fair Queen, Dame Guinevere the gay:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many bold Barons, sitting in hall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With ladies attired in purple and pall....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it was here, too, that was installed the immortal
Round Table, with the chivalrous knights that sat
about it.</p>

<p>You will find this Camelot a mile or two from
Sparkford station, between Castle Cary and Yeovil,
on the main line from Paddington to Weymouth.
It is a great rounded hill seared with ancient ramparts
and ditches, and crowned by a mound which
was King Arthur’s palace.</p>

<p>They will tell you that Cadbury Castle is slowly
sinking into the earth; that at one time it was
vastly bigger. But they will tell you, too, that King
Arthur has not forgotten his old home, and that he
and his knights may often be seen galloping round the
old fortifications on moonlight nights, mounted on
gallant chargers shod with silver shoes.</p>

<p>And should you doubt this, antiquarian records will
prove you wrong; for on the hill some years ago, a
silver horseshoe was dug up.</p>

<p>From Cadbury a faint path may still be distinguished
running towards Glastonbury&mdash;you can
see Glastonbury Tor from the top of Cadbury
Castle&mdash;and along this track, if you are lucky, you
may sometimes see the great King, a sad expression
on his face, his knights with their attendant squires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
in his train, riding back to fabled Avalon, which is
Glastonbury, and his tomb in the abbey there beside
that of Queen Guinevere.</p>

<p>It was from Cadbury, when Camelot’s towers
crowned the hill, that the knights set out on their
quest of the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>You will not find it hard to believe these old
legends, if you sit for awhile in the silence and peace
of the great earth bulwarks of Cadbury Castle
and look out across the pleasing country beneath you. You
can almost hear the faint jingle of harness in the air,
and the soft whisperings of dead and gone men and
women who had looked upon Arthur himself.</p>

<p>Apart from its legendary interest, Cadbury Castle
is one of the most remarkable places in all Somersetshire.
Four high earth walls surround the hill, the
innermost faced with stone. Within the lowest
rampart you will find King Arthur’s well; on the hill
side strange terraces that were once, they will tell you,
shady gardens where fair ladies walked in the cool of
a summer’s evening.</p>

<p>The little stream, the Cam, flows from the foot of
the hill, and close at hand are the villages of Queen
Camel and West Camel, again suggesting the old name
of Cadbury.</p>

<p>But Somersetshire is steeped in Arthurian legendary
lore. In the far north of the county near Clevedon
another Cadbury disputes with our hill the honour
of having borne upon it Camelot. And Glastonbury,
almost midway between the two, is the very centre of
Arthurian romance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Around the history of the great King has arisen so
much controversy that you must read the experts
for yourself and make your own choice. And what
could provide a more glorious holiday amusement
than a quiet journey through this, King Arthur’s
own, land on a pilgrimage to the many beautiful
places it holds that commemorate in name and
tradition the life of the greatest hero of romance in
Western literature?</p>

</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Nobody knows how long ago it was
when the Witch of Wookey was alive,
but she was a terribly hideous person,
and she did all sorts of horrible things
until a monk of Glastonbury Abbey
decided that she had wrought quite enough evil,
and determined to rid Somersetshire of her baleful
presence.</p>

<p>She lived in a grim cavern a mile or so from that
wonderful cathedral city of Wells, and to this day you
may visit Wookey Hole, her habitation, and see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
very rightful fate that overcame this wicked woman.
As an old poet wrote of her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Deep in the dreary, dismal cell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which seemed, and was ycleped hell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This blear-eyed hag did hide.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They say that in her youth, she was a very beautiful
woman, yet no man fell in love with her, and so,
becoming embittered, she made a bargain with the
powers of evil, so that she might wreak her vengeance
upon all mankind for the slight, she held, they had
put upon her.</p>

<p>The devil gave her nine imps to assist her in her
wicked work, and she, with her loathly helpers, sat
in Wookey Hole, plotting misery for all the country-side.
She blighted the crops, sent murrain among
the flocks and herds, wove spells that created suspicion
in happy homes and turned family love into
violent hatred. But particularly the witch delighted
to cause lovers’ quarrels. It was a happy day in
Wookey Hole in those times, when one of the
demons had caused a country lass and her swain to
quarrel on the eve of their wedding. Then it was
that the sounds of demoniac laughter that issued from
the cavern were at their loudest.</p>

<p>But all this sorrow that fell upon the people touched
the heart of a young monk of Glastonbury. He had
been disappointed in love, and had found consolation
in the cloister; but he was determined that others’
lives should not be similarly ruined if he could
help it. So he went up to Wookey to beard the hag in
her den.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>No other possessed such courage, and the young
monk went alone. He approached the place chanting
a psalm, then, with holy water, he sprinkled the
outside of the cavern and began the old service of
exorcism. There was tremendous confusion within
the cave at this unexpected intrusion. The witch
rallied her servants around her and started out to do
great violence to this reckless priest; but before she
emerged, the monk, singing a “Paternoster,” fearlessly
entered the “Hole.”</p>

<p>He sprinkled with holy water all that he
encountered&mdash;and all that the miraculous liquid
touched turned to stone. Never from that moment
did any further evil issue from the cave at Wookey.</p>

<p>And, to-day, if you go there, you may see, as they
have been these many centuries past, the petrified
witch in her kitchen, cut off suddenly by this good
brother of Glastonbury in the very midst of her
wickedness, with her various household utensils, also
turned into stone, all about her. Anyone may enter
Wookey Hole now, and emerge unharmed.</p>

<p>Wells is your best centre for visiting Wookey. The
city itself with its splendid cathedral, its ancient
houses and its moated Episcopal Palace, is one of the
most interesting in all England.</p>

<p>Glastonbury is near at hand, with the remains of
its great abbey from which the good monk came, and
its marvellous thorn tree, as legend has it, sprung
from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea, who, having
wandered from the Holy Land, decided to end his
days in this pleasant place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>This is traditional Avalon, a town, perhaps, richer
in history and romance than any other in our land.
King Arthur and Guinevere his queen, they say,
were buried within the walls of the ancient abbey
over which, as the old tale tells, St. Patrick and
St. Benedict once presided as Abbots.</p>

<p>And, should you weary of history, there are all the
natural beauties of the Mendip hills for you to
explore; for both Wells and Glastonbury lie on the
slopes of this beautiful range.</p>

<p>Few places in Europe have so much of interest to
offer the visitor as Wells and Glastonbury and that
pleasing country all around, over which, in the dark
ages, the Witch of Wookey wielded her gruesome
sway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">GUY, OF GUY’S CLIFF.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Some people may tell you that there
never was such a person as the valiant
Guy, Earl of Warwick, who slew the
terrible Dun Cow that terrorized middle
England in the old days, and, single
handed, defeated the giant Colbrond, and cut off his
head. But if you go to Warwick’s beautiful castle
you may see, to-day, the brave Guy’s armour, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
some bones of the ferocious cow. And there is the
old tale of Guy, handed down for centuries, to prove
that this mighty warrior really did live.</p>

<p>This is the old tale. After Guy had slain the Dun
Cow, and had been to the Holy Land on a pilgrimage,
he returned in disguise, and unrecognised,
feeling that he wished to withdraw from the world
and live a secluded life as a hermit. But before he
did so he undertook the slaying of the giant Colbrond.
Having killed this monster and cut off his head, he
slipped away quietly and wandered slowly to his home
at Warwick.</p>

<p>There his wife, the good Lady Phyllis, awaited his
return from Palestine. She had no idea that he was
home again, nor did she recognise him in his rough
pilgrim’s dress when he, together with other wayfarers,
presented himself in the Great Hall and
received from her own hands the alms that she gave
daily to the poor.</p>

<p>And Guy did not announce his identity. Instead,
he passed on and sought out a hermit who lived in
a cave near by, seeking spiritual comfort from the
holy man.</p>

<p>After Guy had been with the hermit a very short
time, that pious man died; and Guy decided to take
his place. And so, for two years, this once mighty
warrior lived the hard, austere life of a recluse in a
bare cell, only a mile or two from his own proud
castle.</p>

<p>But death was creeping upon him. And, when he
realized that he had but a few hours more to live, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
sent, by a trusty messenger, his wedding ring to the
Lady Phyllis, begging her to come and take charge of
his burial. She came at once, all filled with fear and
distress, bringing with her the bishop and high clergy
of the diocese. But there they found the great Guy,
dead, on the steps of the altar of his little chapel.
And there they buried him, and, only a few weeks
later, the Lady Phyllis by his side, for she too died
swiftly, of a broken heart.</p>

<p>And the old story is still told about the country-side
to show how one who had fame, great wealth, high
position, and love, sacrificed it all for the lowly yet
holy calling of a simple heremite.</p>

<p>All this happened so long ago that nobody knows
exactly when it was, but you may still see at Guy’s
Cliff, that beautiful old place a short walk from
Warwick, the cave in the rock where the hermit and
Guy lived. And in the little chapel of St. Mary
Magdalene there, you will see carved in the living rock
a mighty figure, eight feet high, of the fearless Guy;
though time has wrought much damage to this
strange effigy.</p>

<p>Warwick and Leamington are both close at hand;
Warwick, one of the most picturesque towns in the
whole country with Shakespeare’s Avon flowing
gently by it, and the grim and wonderful Warwick
Castle with its grounds stretching to the river’s
edge. And Leamington, that bright clean-streeted
spa, with its healing waters, and its quiet atmosphere
of other days, when our great-grandfathers
posted to it from all parts of the country to drink the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
waters and to indulge in the gaiety of the latest and
most fashionable of inland watering-places.</p>

<p>All round about is the rich leafy England that
Shakespeare knew so well. Stratford-on-Avon is
but eight miles away. Shottery&mdash;the village of
Shakespeare’s wife, where Anne Hathaway’s charming
little cottage still stands&mdash;Henley-in-Arden,
Charlecote, and Hampton Lucy; pretty historic
names we know so well, are all in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This country has a sixteenth century atmosphere
even now. It is one that the foreign visitor seldom
misses; yet the British tourist knows all too little
of it and its peculiar rural beauty and charm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GHOSTLY BISHOP OF FINGEST.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Nestling under the Chiltern Hills, at
the head of the quiet Hambleden valley,
through which a tiny stream runs to join
the Thames a couple of miles or so below
Henley, is the sleepy little village of
Fingest, where, in days gone by, the Bishops of
Lincoln had a palace.</p>

<p>One of these prelates, Bishop Burghersh, lies buried
here, but they say that he does not rest quietly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
tomb in which they laid him, with pomp and ceremony,
these five hundred years and more since. For
Burghersh in life was not all that a bishop should be.</p>

<p>Burghersh was more a prince of the Church than a
humble shepherd of souls, and his worldly ambition
led him to adopt the most unworthy means in order to
aggrandize his estate. He played the haughty tyrant
over the simple timid villagers, and shamelessly
grabbed here a piece and there a piece of the common
land to add to his own park, and to provide him with
the hunting that he loved more than the services of
the Church.</p>

<p>And very stern was Burghersh, too, in upholding
the game laws. The wretched peasant caught poaching
on land which was justly his was given little
mercy. The bishop’s foresters had the strictest
orders to keep the villagers in their place&mdash;which
was the other side of the Episcopal fence.</p>

<p>But at length Burghersh died, and they buried him
with all the elaborate ritual of those far away days;
and the village folk were not, perhaps, so sorry as they
pretended to be, for at last, they thought, they were
rid of their tyrant neighbour and looked for better
times under his successor. But they were wrong.</p>

<p>Bishop Burghersh, in death, so the story goes,
developed the conscience he had never known in
life. He could not rest in peace.</p>

<p>Soon the rumour began to spread about the lonely
country-side of a ghostly wanderer with the dead
bishop’s face and voice, but clad as a keeper or
forester, who glided among the trees of the Episcopal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
park, and put himself in the way of passers by begging
them to help him find repose.</p>

<p>Not until all the land that he had stolen from the
people, to enlarge his park, was returned to the
rightful owners could he cease his nightly wanderings,
he said. He appeared to his successors,
beseeching them, for his soul’s sake, to dispark
the ill-gotten land, but they would not listen to him.
Instead they tried to put him to rest with chaunt and
prayer; but this was unavailing.</p>

<p>Time went by, and others held the bishop’s land,
and held fast to it, despite the ceaseless pleadings of
the unhappy wraith, and even to this day they will
tell you, sometimes floating along by the hedge of
some quiet meadow, or flitting between the trees in a
lonely copse, you may see a pale, sad-faced form
in Lincoln green, seeking someone who will listen to
his weary appeal, and return to the people the
common land which he enclosed in the days when
Edward III. was King of England.</p>

<p>Fingest to-day, you will find, a very charming little
place amid woods and hills. Its fine old church has
not changed much since Bishop Burghersh lived his
selfish life in this quiet vale. There are traces of
Saxon work in the Church, masonry that was three
or four hundred years old in the bishop’s time, and
an unusual tower of great age and height, ending in
twin red gables, rises high above the little church.</p>

<p>Down the valley you come, in a few miles, to Hambleden,
with its picturesque old manor house, and a
little further on to a beautiful reach of the Thames,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
midway between Henley and Medmenham, with its
old abbey and its memories of the eighteenth century
“Hell Fire Club,” and the grim stories told of the
wild and extravagant doings of its dissolute members.</p>

<p>Or go north from Fingest up through the beech
woods and leafy lanes of the Chilterns, or west, till
you rise, in a few miles, to six or seven hundred feet
above sea level in a country that is as remote and
unspoilt as you can wish.</p>

<p>All this you may reach from London in a summer
day’s trip. Strike north from Henley or west from
High Wycombe, or West Wycombe, and you will
soon find yourself among little forgotten villages
set among the woods where the Chilterns slope down
to the Thames, amid scenery that is as charming as
any England can show.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">WAYLAND SMITH AND HIS CAVE.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">It was such a long time ago since Wayland
Smith came into this country that even
the most learned men are uncertain as to
his origin. He came, they think, as
Weland, a heathen god, kinsman of Thor,
the Scandinavian God of Thunder; and for many
years he was a being of great importance in Pagan
England. But he fell upon bad times.</p>

<p>Weland seems to have been a hard-working and
humble deity, and when men would no longer work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
for him, he had to work for them. And very good
work he did, too, it seems. Perhaps, in his better
days, he made Thor’s hammers for him; anyhow,
when he came down in the world, he took to the
blacksmith’s trade.</p>

<p>You will come across traces of poor Weland in many
parts of the country, but nowhere will you find a
stranger relic of his working days than in his smithy&mdash;Wayland
Smith’s cave they call it now&mdash;quite close
to the side of that ancient track-way that skirts the
summit of the Berkshire Downs above the White
Horse Vale.</p>

<p>The road, the Ridgeway, was old when the Romans
came. And perhaps it was because of its popularity
that Wayland Smith started his business near at hand.
Anyhow there is his cave to this day, a strange erection
of two great upright stones surmounted by a third,
and there, the old story tells, he shod the horses
of any who would employ him, at less than market
rate, so long as they carried out a perfectly simple
arrangement.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, since once he had been a god and
had had men and horses sacrificed to him, Weland’s
pride would not permit him to come out and tout for
trade; so it was well understood that should you
wish his services you placed a silver penny upon a
flat stone near the cave, left your horse by it, then went
away and sat down out of sight for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Soon you would hear the sound of hammer and
anvil, and presently, when you returned, you would
find your horse well shod&mdash;and your penny gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Weland was very particular about that penny; he
would take neither more nor less for his work, and
unless that actual sum was placed upon the stone
you might wait in vain. He would have no dealings
with you.</p>

<p>Nowadays silver pennies are out of fashion and a
sixpenny piece is the proper fee. And, though
few travellers use the old Ridgeway in these times, there
are some who believe that, if you have faith, you may
still have your horse shod for sixpence, high up there
on the lonely downs, if you carry out the proper
procedure.</p>

<p>You come to the cave from Shrivenham station,
a few miles east of Swindon; thence the Lambourn
road will lead you straight up on to the downs. On
the summit you will find the soft-turfed Ridgeway,
which you must follow to the left and you will come
in a short time to Wayland Smith’s lonely abode.</p>

<p>If you continue still further along the old way, you
find yourself at mysterious Uffington Castle, the
gaunt earthwork from which Alfred the Great
routed the Danish invaders over a thousand years
ago. Here you are eight hundred odd feet above the
sea, and on camp-crowned Whitehorse Hill, on the
side of which is the famous White Horse that names
both the hill and the vale beneath. Alfred caused
this horse to be cut in the close turf, they say, to
commemorate his great victory over the invading
Danes; for this, historians will tell you, is Aeschendune,
the scene of Alfred’s mighty and triumphant
battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>East, south and west, the bare downs stretch, away
from you for miles, hiding in their folds little lonely
villages, fertile and sheltered, and bearing on their
summits a thousand memorials of the early peoples
that went to make up our English race.</p>

<p>Here is a holiday country of which few tourists
know; a wide open upland district of keen fresh
winds, and sweet soft turf, where you may wander for
hours with nothing but the grazing sheep, or perhaps
a gipsy encampment, to remind you of civilization.</p>

<p>There is a charm about this solitude that makes it
easy to realize why poor dethroned Weland chose
this land in which to hide his wounded pride.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HERNE THE HUNTER.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The story of Herne the Hunter was
familiar in Shakespeare’s days, as those
who have read “The Merry Wives of
Windsor” know; but like all old stories
it has many versions, and some say that
Herne lived in Plantagenet times, others as recently
as Good Queen Bess’ reign; some, that he was a
poacher, others, a keeper. But all agree that he
haunted Windsor Forest, and some say that he does
so to this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>As the legend is generally told Herne was a royal
keeper whose unusual skill at the chase caused him
to become a great favourite of his royal master, and at
the same time made his fellow foresters mighty jealous
of him. So they combined together to try to plot
his undoing.</p>

<p>To one of their secret councils, held beneath
great oaks in the heart of the forest, there came one
day a mysterious dark man of unusual stature and
strength, whose face seemed familiar yet whom none
could place. To their enquiries he answered
gruffly that he lived on the outskirts of the forest,
and that he knew their designs and could help them,
if they wished it.</p>

<p>The jealous keepers at once accepted his offer.
But he bargained with them, asking as the price of his
aid that they should each grant one request whenever
it was made. This was agreed, and the stranger disappeared,
telling the now rather alarmed foresters
that they should soon have proof of his powers.</p>

<p>Within a few days it was noticed that Herne’s
skill began to fail him. He could no longer shoot
straight, nor ride fast; and very swiftly he fell into
disfavour. His rivals were delighted, particularly
when the day came that he was dismissed from the
Royal service.</p>

<p>That same night there was a terrible thunderstorm,
and in the morning the body of Herne was found
hanging from a lightning-stricken tree in the Little
Park. He had killed himself.</p>

<p>For a time nothing unusual happened; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
strange stories began to get about of a ghostly huntsman,
in figure like the dead Herne, with stag’s horns
growing from his head, who rode through the forest
at night on a fierce black charger, harrying the King’s
deer. This proved to be only too true as the depleted
herds of deer soon proved, and the keepers were
threatened with dire punishment if the depredations
were not stopped.</p>

<p>The keepers, greatly alarmed, went the next night to
Herne’s oak to see if the story were true; and there
they were met by the dark stranger. But now there
was no doubt as to his identity. He appeared in a
flash of sulphurous flame, and they knew him to be
the Evil One. He told the terrified men that Herne
would appear to them soon, and that they must do
exactly what he bade them do, otherwise he would
seize their souls.</p>

<p>Soon Herne appeared, a ghostly figure with huge
antlers, and commanded his fellow-keepers to
assemble at the oak the next midnight with horses and
hounds equipped for the chase. They had to obey,
and night after night, led by the ghostly huntsman, the
party swept through the forest.</p>

<p>Their wild doings naturally quickly reached the ears
of the King, and he summoned the keepers, demanding
an explanation. In terror they confessed how
they had plotted Herne’s ruin, and the King, furious
at their impious action, caused all of them to be
hanged upon Herne’s oak.</p>

<p>But the ghostly chase still went on, they say, and
even to this day in the dark midnight hours some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
people believe you may hear, far away in the Great
Park, the distant sound of a huntsman’s horn, and see
flashing through the trees the ghostly chase led by an
antlered man on a huge black horse.</p>

<p>Herne’s oak has gone now. It stood in the Home
Park, a grim withered riven stump near the footpath
to Datchet, until some fifty or sixty years ago; and
few cared to pass it at midnight.</p>

<p>But Windsor Park in daytime has nothing eerie
about it. It, and the wide bracken-covered, sandy
forest country that surrounds it, is delightful in
Spring, or on a hot summer’s day. Or in autumn,
when the leaves and bracken are turning, one must
go far to find a more beautiful district. The whole
country is steeped in history and romance.</p>

<p>From Windsor, with its magnificent castle&mdash;and
just across the river, historic Eton&mdash;the forest district
stretches away south and west for miles. Here,
although so close to London, one may find the solitude
and rest that many travel far
afield to seek&mdash;and fail to find.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GHOST OF BISHAM ABBEY.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">This legend begins with the story of a
rather dull little boy who found his
lessons very trying&mdash;and, perhaps, the
glistening Thames, which he could see
from his schoolroom window, very
attractive&mdash;in the days when Tudor sovereigns
reigned in England. His name was Hobby, and
his home was Bisham Abbey, which still stands by
the riverside just opposite Great Marlow. And
because the child could not write in his copy-book<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
without making blots, he was whipped so severely
that, as the old tale goes, he died. But that is
only the beginning of the story.</p>

<p>It was his mother, Lady Hobby, who chastised the
child. When you see her portrait, as you still may at
Bisham, you cannot believe she meant to be so cruel.
She must have been sorry for her harshness; at any
rate she has been punished for it, for she can find no
rest in death. Though over three hundred years have
passed since they placed her in her grave, her ghost
still floats through the panelled chambers of Bisham,
so they say.</p>

<p>It is a queer apparition this. It is that of a stately
woman dressed in coif, weeds and wimple, with grave
face and long thin hands, in front of which a basin,
suspended by no visible means, always appears. The
lady is forever trying to wash her hands in the basin,
but it always moves from her before she can achieve
her desire. Not until she can cleanse those delicate
hands, can she find repose, they will tell you.</p>

<p>And a curious thing about the ghost is that it
appears as a “negative,” to use a photographer’s
term. What in life was white is in the spirit black;
and what was black, now white. The wraith is seen
with black face and hands, black coif and wimple;
the basin is black. But the sable gown is white, the
shoes white. White eyes look mournfully from the
dark face.</p>

<p>You may not credit this strange story, for few people
living have seen the wandering lady. Yet undeniable
records will tell you that eighty odd years since, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
they were doing some repairs to the old building,
a window shutter was removed in the room in which
tradition asserted the unhappy boy was taught.
Pushed in between shutter and wall, were a number
of children’s copy-books of the Elizabethan time.
One of them, yellow and soiled with age, corresponded
exactly with the copy-book of the story. There was
not a single line which was not blotted.</p>

<p>Bisham Abbey is a wonderful old place; its
history starts with the Knights Templars in the
reign of King Stephen of turbulent memory. Later
it became an Augustine priory, and later still, when it
had passed from the monks, poor harassed Princess
Elizabeth was there, a prisoner in charge of Sir
Thomas Hobby, in those times when no one could
guess that she was to become the great and glorious
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The old building has seen the Thames flow by to
the sea for eight centuries and more, and still it
remains, one of the most attractive of all the famous
houses that have arisen upon the banks of the
great river. It is a short mile across the bridge from
Great Marlow, that restful riverside town on one
of the most pleasing reaches of the Thames. Here
the river is at its best, bordered by peaceful shady
lawns, where you may idle away a hot summer
afternoon amid refreshing scenery that only England
can show.</p>

<p>Down stream, seven miles past Cookham, you come
to busy Maidenhead. Upstream eight miles and you
are at Henley Bridge. Cookham lock they call the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
most beautifully situated of all on the river. Wild
flowers grow in profusion on the banks of the tow-path
side, and the famous woods of Cliveden look
down upon the gently flowing river.</p>

<p>Yet, if you be wise, sometimes you will leave the
fascination of the river and wander a mile or two
inland and see the queer, quiet little villages that stand
away from the river bank; or adventure, perhaps,
from Bourne End up the Wye valley towards High
Wycombe and find picturesque Penn&mdash;not the
home of the family of the founder of Pennsylvania,
but of one with which it was connected&mdash;and see in
the church the memorials to some of the grandchildren
of the famous William Penn.</p>

<p>To find Penn’s grave you must go a little further
afield, through Beaconsfield to Jordans, where in the
little Quaker burial ground that one of the greatest
of the founders of the United States lies buried in a
simple grave.</p>

<p>In all this fascinating country you are seldom
more than thirty miles
from London, and always
within touch of a station from
which you can reach Paddington
in about an hour’s journey.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE EVIL WEDDING OF STANTON DREW.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-u.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Under the southern slopes of bold
Dundry Hill in North Somersetshire
you will find the queerly named little
river Chew, on the banks of which is the
village of Stanton Drew. Nowadays it
is an out-of-the-way little spot, but far back in
history it must have been a place of considerable
importance, for close to its church are the remains
of what was once a gigantic building&mdash;some call it a
Druid temple&mdash;of a very early race of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>There are the relics of at least three stone circles,
and about the smallest of these a strange story is told.
It is the story of the Evil Wedding, and it explains
why the stones came there.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, as the tale goes, there had been a
marriage at Stanton Drew, and the wedding party
met on the place where now the stone circle stands
to indulge in feasting and dancing. It was on a
Saturday, and the festivities were at their height
when midnight struck. Then the harpist, a pious
old man, who was playing for the dancing merry-makers,
refused to continue any longer, saying that he
would not profane the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Each member of the party tried to persuade the aged
musician to continue, and chief among the suppliants
was the bride, who grew very angry at the harpist’s
continual refusals. She would go on with the dance
for all his obstinate ways, she said, and she would
find another musician even if she had to go to the
nether world in search of him.</p>

<p>At that moment a venerable old man with a long
grey beard wandered out of the night and asked what
all the altercations was about.</p>

<p>When they told him, he gave a merry laugh and said
that he would play for them; so the pious old harpist
departed, and the dance began again.</p>

<p>The new musician, playing on a pipe, started off
with rather a doleful air, but he soon livened up, and
very quickly the dancers were whirling round and
round in the maddest abandon. But to their
consternation as they grew tired, and wished to stop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
they found they were unable to do so. The more
weary they became, the harder the piper played, and
when they begged him to cease he merely laughed
at them and changed his tune to one yet more
lively.</p>

<p>At last dawn began to show in the sky, and the now
frenzied and terrified dancers saw their musician
remove the pipe from his mouth. But they saw, too,
when he got up, that he had a club foot, and that
beneath his long gown a tail showed.</p>

<p>The moment he ceased to play, the dancers remained
fixed in strange attitudes, quite unable to
move. “I will return later and play for you again,”
said the Fiend as he walked away, uttering horrible
laughter. But he has not yet returned, and later
that morning the villagers found the fields, where
the wedding party had been held, strewn with huge
upright stones, many of which remain to this day.
And they say that there they will stand until the devil
returns to play his evil tune; then the stones will
become men and women again and will take up once
more their mad dance.</p>

<p>If you doubt this moral story, go to Stanton Drew
and see the strange stones for yourself&mdash;and suggest
in what other way they could have come there. You
may reach Stanton Drew from Pensford station on the
line between Bristol and Frome. You will find it
in a pleasant little valley in a hilly upland country,
and not far away Maensknoll Tump, nearly 700 feet
high, the loftiest point of Dundry Hill, surrounded
by the grim earthworks of some of our earliest
ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Bristol, that great city of the west, with its centuries
of history and romance, its memories of the daring
Merchant Adventurers and its fine churches, is a
good centre from which to reach this district. Or
you may go from Frome, that queer busy little town
with its narrow medieval streets straggling up and
down hill.</p>

<p>All the country round here is full of interest to the
lover of nature or antiquity. It is a country of mild
airs, where in the sheltered valleys the flowers bloom
amazingly early. Yet the average tourist seldom
wanders off the beaten track to enjoy this pleasing
stretch of rural England.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE STORY OF WILD DARRELL.</h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">There is a strange story told of Littlecote
Manor, a glorious old Tudor mansion
that lies not far from the pleasant little
Berkshire town of Hungerford. This,
in Elizabeth’s time, was the ancestral
home of the Darrells; but “Wild Darrell,” the last
of them to hold it, had to sacrifice the place to save
his wicked life. At least so the old tales tell.</p>

<p>This grim story begins with the awakening at dead
of night of the village nurse at Shefford, some seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
miles away from Littlecote. Masked messengers
bade her come at once to a waiting coach to tend a
lady “not far away.” She was to ask no questions,
she was told, and she must submit to be blindfolded
until she reached her destination. But to compensate
her for this strange treatment a heavy purse of gold
was offered. The nurse, torn between emotions of
fear and greed, accepted; and the coach set off.</p>

<p>After a long drive through the winter night, the
lumbering vehicle at last came to a halt. The
blindfolded nurse was led up a great staircase and,
when her bandages were removed, she found herself
in a richly furnished bedroom where lay a masked
lady in a huge four-post bed.</p>

<p>The nurse had no idea where she was, but her
natural curiosity had caused her to make whatever
mental notes she could. For one thing she counted
the steps leading to the bedroom; for another she
managed, while going about her work, to clip off a
small piece of a heavy curtain which screened the
window of the room. But of this later.</p>

<p>In due course there came a new born baby into the
world. But fearful as the nurse had been at the
mystery of the whole affair, she was terrified at what
followed, for when the child was but a few hours
old there came to the bedroom a man of ferocious
manner, whose face, like those of all with whom she
had come in contact, was masked, and snatching the
child from the mother’s arms, barbarously killed it.</p>

<p>The nurse, in her horror, swooned; and when she
regained consciousness she was being carried from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
coach at the door of her own cottage. Before she
could recover her wits the coach had gone, and she was
left unable to decide whether the whole affair was
some horrid dream, or whether she had really
witnessed the terrible scene which had burnt itself
into her memory.</p>

<p>But the discovery in her hand of the promised
reward proved to her that it was no dream.</p>

<p>For some months the nurse kept her own counsel,
fearful perhaps that should she speak she would lose
the big reward which she had received. But at last,
falling ill, and thinking herself about to die, she made
a full confession. Enquiries were made, and the
woman taken at last to Littlecote, where she identified
the very room in which the crime had been committed.
As final proof the piece of curtain she had
taken with her was found to fit a hole in one of the
curtains of the room.</p>

<p>“Wild Darrell,” they say, was arrested and brought
to trial; but he managed to save his life by bribery,
giving his whole estate to the judge who tried him in
order to secure acquittal. But he did not live long
after the trial. Still remaining in the neighbourhood,
he gave himself up to the wildest debauchery in an
endeavour to escape from the ghost of the murdered
infant. Riding about the downs one night, they tell,
the wraith of the child suddenly appeared in his path.
His horse reared back in fright and threw its rider.
The next morning they found him where he had
fallen, with his neck broken.</p>

<p>They say “Wild Darrell” still rides the country-side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
of nights, and that a baby’s ghost for many years
haunted an oak panelled room in Littlecote Manor.
But you must please yourself whether to believe
this or not.</p>

<p>At any rate Littlecote looks the sort of stately,
romantic house that should be haunted. It lies in
the peaceful Kennet valley, close by that stream so
famous for its trout.</p>

<p>A mile or two away rise the fine open Marlborough
Downs with their many relics of ancient civilization.
Three or four miles to the westward and you are in
glorious Savernake Forest with its silent glades and
its world famous avenues. Hungerford itself is a
quiet, tidy little market town, little known to the
tourist, yet a wonderfully convenient centre for
visiting the country that surrounds it. Gallows-crowned
Inkpen Beacon is but a few miles off, a hill
that misses being a mountain by only forty odd feet.</p>

<p>This is a magnificent country for the fisherman and
the pedestrian; its hill tops are as lonely as the
Welsh mountain summits,
its leafy woods as unfrequented
as an Alpine forest. Yet
you may reach Hungerford in
under a couple of hours from
London; see Littlecote, the
scene of “Wild Darrell’s” terrible
action, wander over
the hills, and return to Town
between breakfast time and
dinner on a summer’s day.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Somewhere about 700 years ago, a
monk in famous Reading Abbey composed
a song in praise of Spring. Its
words and music were written down at
the time and you may see them to-day
at the British Museum.</p>

<p>That song&mdash;they call it our oldest song&mdash;was
“Sumer is icumen in,” and its author, antiquaries
believe to have been, one John of Fornsete. They
say this famous ancient “Round” was written some
time between 1226 and 1240 when King Henry III
was on the throne, and when the signing of Magna
Carta was but a few years old in the memory of living
men.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful old song, very simple, yet somehow
bringing up a picture of the unchanging Spring
as it came those centuries ago to the river meadows
of the silver Thames, that stretched away from
Reading’s mighty Abbey, then a comparatively
modern building, little more than a hundred years
old. And some young brother, at work in the fields
perhaps, overjoyed to see the sun and the green
leaves again, finding expression of his joy in song and
music.</p>

<p>To-day you may still find many remains of that
stately Abbey at Reading, which became one of the
richest in the land. Its inner gateway still stands and
its guest house, as well as many ivy clad ruins of its
other buildings.</p>

<p>And Reading, for all its busy modern life retains
much of its old-world atmosphere in its fine churches
and queerly named streets. And here, too, you will
find, in the Museum, relics of Roman Britain unequalled
in England, for to Reading have been
brought the treasures excavated at Roman Silchester
a few miles away, the buried city sometimes called
the British Pompeii.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Reading teems with objects
of natural beauty and historic interest, which more
than repay the examination of the visitor to this, at
first sight, rather modest modern red brick country
town. Reading has seen in its time a very full share
of England’s history and romance.</p>

<p>NOTE.&mdash;The original composition of “Sumer is icumen in” took six persons to sing it. The
modernised version given on the next page is for a solo voice with pianoforte
accompaniment. In it the old wording has been slightly modernised, the only
archaic word occurring being “sterteth” which means “frisketh,” and “verteth”
now an obsolete term indicating to go to the vert or the greenwood. “Sumer is
icumen in” means literally: Summer has come in.</p>

<p>The old version with the ancient notation, English and Latin words, and instructions
as to singing, shows very much the form of the original 13th century manuscript.</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
